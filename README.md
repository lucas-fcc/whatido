# WhatIDo?!

WhatIDo is an application to manage tasks, where users can create lists with different tasks that they have to do and receive suggestions for which task to start if they are undecided.

It was created as my final project for the [Full Stack Web Development Specialization course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack) from Coursera.

You can see a live version running [here](https://whatido.glitch.me/), and the API documentation [here](https://whatido.glitch.me/apidoc/);

### How To Run

  - Run `npm install` to download the dependencies;
  - Create a `.env` file with the following structure and fill the gaps:
```
PASSPORT_SECRET=
PORT=
SMTP_SERVER=
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_KEY=
```
  - Make sure you have MongoDB running;
  - Run `npm start` to run the application;
  - Run `npm test` to run the test cases.
